# Getting Started

## Installation

The first step is to install Pythia. You can get it through [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1m2o3L8CQo).

### Troubleshoot

To check if Pythia was installed correctly, open a shell and enter the following line:

```sh
root $ pyc --version
```

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest stable version that has been released, in the following format:

```sh
root $ pyc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
```

If you see this information, you have installed Pythia successfully!
